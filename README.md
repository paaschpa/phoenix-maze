# HelloPhoenix

Trying to port Rawkets (https://github.com/robhawkes/rawkets) to Elixir and Phoenix. FYI - no Twitter login necessary.
Demo site at http://canarymod16.cloudapp.net/rawkets but I don't always have it running since I think it'll burn throw my spending limit. 

Todos:
- hits and kill
- get unneccessary files (mnesia/suffixed ~ files/etc out of repo
- dont use numbers for message types


To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
